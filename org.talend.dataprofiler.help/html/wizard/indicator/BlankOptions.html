	<p>
	
	When aggregating text data, the following options are available:
	<p>
	- aggregate nulls with blanks: when selected, null data are counted as zero length text field. This means that they are treated as an empty string. When not selected, null data are treated as any other text data.
	<p>
	- aggregate blanks: when selected, blank texts (e.g. " ") are all grouped together and considered as an empty string. When not selected, blank texts are treated as any other text data.
    <p>
    Note: On Oracle, empty strings and null strings are the same objects. Therefore, you need to check or uncheck both checkboxes here in order to get consistent results.
