	<h1>Text Length:</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	
	When computing the length of a text data, the following options are available:
	<p>
	- count nulls: when selected, null data are counted as zero length text field. When not selected, null data are not taken into account in the results.
	<p>
	- count blanks: when selected, blank texts (e.g. "  ") are counted as zero length text fields. When not selected, blank texts are not taken into account in the results.
    <p>
    Note: On Oracle, empty strings and null strings are the same objects. Therefore, you need to check or uncheck both checkboxes here in order to get consistent results.
