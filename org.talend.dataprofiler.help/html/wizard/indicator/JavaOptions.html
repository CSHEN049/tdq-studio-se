	When Java is used to compute this indicator, you can specify the mapping of the characters. 
	The first field must contain the list of characters to be replaced.
	The second field must contain the list of the replacement characters. 
	<p>
	Each character of the first field will be replaced by the character at the same position in the second field. 
	<p>
	For example, with the following values of the fields,<br>
    "abc0123ABC,;.:"<br>
    "aaa9999AAApppp"<br>
    <p>
    any "a", "b" or "c" will be replaced by "a"<br>
    any "0", "1", "2" or "3" will be replaced by "9"<br>
    any ",", ";", ".", ":" will be replaced by "p"<br>
