	<h1>SQL Expressions:</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	In the first page of the wizard, set the name of the pattern so that you can find it easily.  
	</p>
	<p>
	In the second page, set the sql pattern to be used in analyses.   
	<br>
	<b><u>The pattern must be surrounded with single quotes "'". </u></b>
	<br>
	Once the pattern is created, you can drag &amp; drop it onto a column in the Multiple Column Analysis editor.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note:
	<br>
	SQL patterns are different from Regular patterns. 
	<br>
	For example, if you search strings starting with 'S', the regular pattern is 'S%', not  'S.*'. 
	<br>
	SQL pattern are more easily supported by the databases:
	<br>
	they appear in the « LIKE » clause of an SQL statement.
	<br>
	Queries with SQL patterns can be faster than queries with regular expressions. 
	<br>
	But they are usually far less powerful. 
	<br>
	Please refer to the documentation of your Database Management System for more details.
