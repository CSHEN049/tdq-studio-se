	<h1>Soundex frequency statistics</h1>
	<hr>
	
	Indicators in this group use the Soundex algorithm built in the DBMS. 
	<p>
	They index records by sounds. This way, records with the same pronunciation (only English pronunciation) are encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.
	<p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Soundex frequency table: computes the number of most frequent distinct records relative to the total number of records having the same pronunciation.</li>
		<p>
	    <li>Soundex low frequency table: computes the number of less frequent distinct records relative to the total number of records having the same pronunciation.</li>
    </ul>
