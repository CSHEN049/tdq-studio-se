	<hr>
	
	They determine the most probable and the most frequent values and builds frequency tables. The main advanced statistics include the following values:
	<p>
	
	<ul>
    	<li>Mode: computes the most probable value. For numerical data or continuous data, you can set bins in the parameters of this indicator. It is different from the "average" and the "median". It is good for addressing categorical attributes.</li>
		<p>
    	<li>Frequency table: computes the number of most frequent values for each distinct record. Other frequency table indicators are available to aggregate data with respect to "date", "week", "month", "quarter", "year" and "bin".
    		<p>
    		Note: Frequency table statistics are applied only on columns that have "date" data.</li>
		<p>
    	<li>Low frequency table: computes the number of less frequent records for each distinct record. Other low frequency table indicators are available for each of the following values: "date", "week", "month", "quarter", "year" and "bin" where "bin" is the aggregation of numerical data by intervals.</li>
	</ul>
