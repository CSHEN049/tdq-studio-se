 * Contains the text of the single DASDL <comment> that nearly every object in a DASDL source may have. These comments differ from Remarks in that there is only one instance per DASDL object, their position in the source is constrained, and they
 * are stored in the database description files. Remarks are not tied to particular database objects, can occur anywhere in a DASDL source, and exist only in the DASDL source itself. 
 * 
 * For all DASDLComments, the language attribute contains the string "DASDL".
