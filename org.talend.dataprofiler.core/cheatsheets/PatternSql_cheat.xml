         SQL patterns are different from Regular patterns. 
For example, if you search strings starting with &apos;S&apos;, the regular pattern is &apos;S%&apos;, not &apos;S.*&apos;. 
SQL pattern are more easily supported by the databases: 
they appear in the « LIKE » clause of an SQL statement. 
Queries with SQL patterns can be faster than queries with regular expressions. 
But they are usually far less powerful. 
Please refer to the documentation of your Database Management System for more details.
