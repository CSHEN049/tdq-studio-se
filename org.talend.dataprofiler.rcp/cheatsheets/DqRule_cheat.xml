         In the editor, you can modify the Rule metadata if required. You can also modify the Business Rule by changing the WHERE clause or by adding a new one. Set the criticality level to indicate the importance of the Business Rule. 
		 
		 To set join conditions, click Join Conditions to expand the editor. Then drop the relevant columns onto the box and define them as either Column A or Column B. Click the Operator cell between the corresponding columns and select the sign which reflects the join condition that you want to define.
