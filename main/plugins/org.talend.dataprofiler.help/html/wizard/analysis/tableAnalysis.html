	<h1>Table Analysis:</h1>
	<p>
	The analysis grain is the row. You want to know whether several rows are identical or similar for instance. This groups all the analyses below the "Table analysis" folder.
    A row is a set of cells that belong to all columns. In this kind of analysis, the row is the indivisible element that you analyze.
    The studio allows the user to choose which columns to focus on. Here, you do a "partial" table analysis in the sense that the indivisible element is not a full row, but a set of cells (belonging to several columns, but not all the columns).
	This analysis enables you to apply your Data Quality rules (DQ Rules) on a selected table. 
	<p>
	Note that you can create DQ rules and assign them to the created analysis at a later stage of the analysis preparation.
