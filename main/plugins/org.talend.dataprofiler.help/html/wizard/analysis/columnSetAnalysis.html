	<h2>Column Set Analysis</h2>
	<p>
This kind of analysis focuses on a column set (full records) and not on separate columns as it is the case
with the column analysis. The statistics presented in the analysis results are the row count, distinct count, unique count and duplicate count which all apply on records (values of a set of columns).
With the Java engine, you may also apply patterns on each column and the result of the analysis will give the number of records matching all the selected patterns together.<br>

Beware that this analysis will retrieve as many rows as the number of distinct rows in order to compute the statistics. Hence, it is advised to avoid selecting primary keys in this kind of analysis.
