	<h1>Column Correlation Analysis:</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>Numerical Correlation Analysis</h2>
	<p>
	This kind of analysis shows correlations between nominal and numerical data in a bubble chart. For each nominal value, the average of the numerical data is computed and represented on the vertical axis with the nominal value on the horizontal axis. 
	<p> 
	One of the aim of this analysis is to easily find data quality issues by looking at the extremal values in the graph. 
	<br>
	<h2>Time Correlation Analysis</h2>
	<p>
	This kind of analysis shows correlations between nominal and time data in a kind of gantt chart. For each nominal value, the minimal and maximal values of the time data is computed and represented as a bar in the chart. 
	<br>
	<h2>Nominal Correlation Analysis</h2>
	<p>
	This kind of analysis works with only nominal values and shows the relations between pairs of data in network graph. It highlights weak relationships between pairs of data in order to find potential incorrect relationships.
