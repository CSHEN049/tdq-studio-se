	<h1>Column Analysis:</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>Semantic Discovery Analysis</h2>
	<p>
	This wizard will automatically configure a column analysis with the appropriate indicators after learning from your data. 
	<p>
	Prerequisite: The semantic repository must be running and accessible in order to start this wizard.
	<p>  
	The wizard will try to guess the meaning of each column and find the related concept in the semantic repository.
	Then given a concept, applicable indicators can be found automatically and added to the columns.
	<p> 
	You'll be able to help the semantic discovery by setting a meaning for each column but it's not mandatory. 
	In the last steps of the wizard, you may decide to enrich the semantic repository with your entries (column meanings, synonyms). 
	Enriching the semantic repository will bring new intelligence to the studios connected to the same semantic repository.
	<p>
	When this analysis is executed, more information is added to the semantic repository, such as thresholds on selected indicators...
	This information is reused when you or another user runs this wizard again on the same kind of data.
