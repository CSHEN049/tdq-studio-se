	<h1>Indicator Thresholds:</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	
	Here, you can define expected thresholds on the indicator's value. 
	<p>
	The range defined here is used for measuring the quality of the data. 
	<p>
	If the indicator's value is outside the defined range, then this means that the data are of bad quality. 
	<p>
	For example, if you define a range [0, 3] on the Blank Indicator, this means that you want the number of blank fields to be less than 3 (included). 
	<p>
	You can define only one threshold or no threshold at all. You may set these thresholds either by value or by percentage with respect to the row count.
