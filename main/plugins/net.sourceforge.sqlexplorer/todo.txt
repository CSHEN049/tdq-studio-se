* add drag support for nodes from structure tree into sqleditor (select few columns and drop into editor to generate select statement)
* create extendible 'snippets' popup that allows you to choose a db specific keyword and paste/drop it into the editor.
  These could be organized by type, e.g. functions, rules, hints, ...   This way, you wouldn't have to remember every db specific
  implementation for TO_DATE('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') for example.

* add 'do not ask again' to some of the prompts

if there is one or more modification in "net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer",we must upload a new jar "net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer_X.X.X.jar"
to web server before release.
HOW to generate the new jar? it takes "5.6.1" as an example:
1.add the modification log to file "chang_log.txt"
2.change the bundle-version in MANIFEST.MF to 5.6.1
3.change the version in SqlExplorerUtils.SQL_EXPLORER_VERSION to "_5.6.1"
4.click the button "Export deployable plug-ins and fragments" in runtime tab.select all the default configuration.
  it will generate a new jar "net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer_5.6.1.jar".
5.put this jar into latest NB and test.
6.upload the new jar "net.sourceforge.sqlexplorer_5.6.1.jar" to web service.
